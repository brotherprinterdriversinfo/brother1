Real-Time Experience: Peter’s Story
-----------------------------------

    “Last week, I upgraded to macOS Sonoma, and suddenly my Brother HL-L2350DW printer stopped working. It wouldn’t respond to any print commands. I went to Brother’s official support page, found the macOS-compatible driver, and installed it within minutes. The instructions were super clear. As soon as I reconnected the printer, it was detected and printed the test page immediately. The new driver actually made printing faster and quieter. Saved me from buying a new printer!”
